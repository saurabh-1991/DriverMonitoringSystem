# DriverMonitoringSystem

## Introduction
A driver-monitoring system — sometimes called a driver state sensing (DSS) system — is an advanced safety feature that uses a camera mounted on the dashboard to track driver drowsiness or distraction, and to issue a warning or alert to get the driver’s attention back to the task of driving

## Dataset
Dataset used to train this custom CNN model is with referance to Kaggle Input Dataset for Driver Monitoring System , It consisted of images taken from cabin camera inside car with field of view towards driver.
Based upon different scenarios 10 Different classes are considered.
